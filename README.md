# Image Pattern merge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is a React web application that can create a simple image collage from a user defined pattern. The images will be placed to an HTML Canvas in the specified pattern.
This way you can easily download the newly generated larger image.

## Prerequisites

All the used images should have the same size.

## Steps

1. Choose the images that you want to merge into a collage. Click Next.

2. Select the pattern for your images in the appearing grid. Click Next.

3. Download the generated image collage by right clicking on it and selecting "Save image as".

## Missing functions / Development possibilities

- Pattern creation improvements (add/remove rows and columns, shifting specific rows/columns by custom pixels)
- Swap images on the result canvas
- Creation of a good looking UI
- UX improvements
